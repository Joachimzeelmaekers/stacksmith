# Exercise 3: Time-Space Tradeoff

Demonstrate the tradeoff between time and space complexity.

## Key Concepts

- Sometimes using more space leads to faster algorithms
- Example: Hash table trades O(N) space for O(1) lookup
- Choose based on constraints of your system

## Run the Solution

- **TypeScript:** `npx tsx src/typescript/chapter19/exercise03.ts`
- **Go:** `go run src/go/chapter19/exercise03/main.go`
