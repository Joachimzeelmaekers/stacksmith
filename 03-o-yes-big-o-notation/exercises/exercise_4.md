# Exercise 4: Big O Growth Comparison

Visualize how different Big O complexities grow with input size.

## Key Takeaways

- O(1) - Constant: Always the same
- O(log N) - Logarithmic: Grows very slowly (binary search)
- O(N) - Linear: Grows proportionally (simple loops)
- O(N log N) - Linearithmic: Efficient sorting (mergesort)
- O(N²) - Quadratic: Avoid for large N (nested loops)

## Run the Solution

- **TypeScript:** `npx tsx src/typescript/chapter03/exercise04.ts`
- **Go:** `go run src/go/chapter03/exercise04/main.go`
