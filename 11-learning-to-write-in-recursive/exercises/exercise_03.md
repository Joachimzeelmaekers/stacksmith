# Exercise 3: Unique Paths in a Grid

Count the number of unique paths from top-left to bottom-right in a grid, moving only right or down.

## Key Concepts

- Base case: reached destination (1 path)
- Recursive case: paths going right + paths going down

## Run the Solution

- **TypeScript:** `npx tsx src/typescript/chapter11/exercise03.ts`
- **Go:** `go run src/go/chapter11/exercise03/main.go`
