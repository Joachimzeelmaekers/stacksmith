# Exercise 2: Best, Worst, Average Case Analysis

Demonstrate how the same algorithm performs differently based on input.

## Key Insight

- Big O typically refers to WORST case
- But best/average cases matter for algorithm choice
- Insertion sort: O(N²) worst, but O(N) best
- This makes it ideal for nearly-sorted data

## Run the Solution

- **TypeScript:** `npx tsx src/typescript/chapter06/exercise02.ts`
- **Go:** `go run src/go/chapter06/exercise02/main.go`
