# Exercise 1: Trie Search

Implement search in a trie (prefix tree).

## Key Concepts

- Each node represents a character
- Traverse character by character
- Check if the final node is marked as end of word

## Complexity

- Time: O(K) where K is the length of the word

## Run the Solution

- **TypeScript:** `npx tsx src/typescript/chapter17/exercise01.ts`
- **Go:** `go run src/go/chapter17/exercise01/main.go`
