# Exercise 1: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Implement BFS traversal on a graph.

## Key Concepts

- Use a queue
- Visit all neighbors before going deeper
- Track visited nodes to avoid cycles

## Complexity

- Time: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges

## Run the Solution

- **TypeScript:** `npx tsx src/typescript/chapter18/exercise01.ts`
- **Go:** `go run src/go/chapter18/exercise01/main.go`
