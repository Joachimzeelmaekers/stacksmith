# Exercise 5: Dijkstra's Algorithm

Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest paths in a weighted graph.

## Key Concepts

- Use a priority queue (min heap)
- Greedy approach: always process the closest unvisited node
- Update distances to neighbors

## Complexity

- Time: O((V + E) log V) with a priority queue

## Run the Solution

- **TypeScript:** `npx tsx src/typescript/chapter18/exercise05.ts`
- **Go:** `go run src/go/chapter18/exercise05/main.go`
