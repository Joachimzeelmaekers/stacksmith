# Exercise 2: Depth-First Search (DFS)

Implement DFS traversal on a graph.

## Key Concepts

- Use a stack (or recursion)
- Go as deep as possible before backtracking
- Track visited nodes to avoid cycles

## Complexity

- Time: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges

## Run the Solution

- **TypeScript:** `npx tsx src/typescript/chapter18/exercise02.ts`
- **Go:** `go run src/go/chapter18/exercise02/main.go`
