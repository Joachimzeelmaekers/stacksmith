# Exercise 4: Detect Cycle in Graph

Detect if a graph contains a cycle.

## Key Concepts

- Use DFS with a "currently visiting" state
- If we encounter a node we're currently visiting, there's a cycle

## Run the Solution

- **TypeScript:** `npx tsx src/typescript/chapter18/exercise04.ts`
- **Go:** `go run src/go/chapter18/exercise04/main.go`
