# Exercise 3: Find Shortest Path (BFS)

Use BFS to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.

## Key Concepts

- BFS naturally finds shortest path in unweighted graphs
- Track the path taken to reach each node

## Run the Solution

- **TypeScript:** `npx tsx src/typescript/chapter18/exercise03.ts`
- **Go:** `go run src/go/chapter18/exercise03/main.go`
