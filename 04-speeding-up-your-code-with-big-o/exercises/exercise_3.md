# Exercise 3: Selection Sort Implementation

Implement and analyze selection sort.

## Time Complexity

**O(N²) always** - Always makes N(N-1)/2 comparisons, but only N-1 swaps maximum. Better than bubble sort when writes are expensive.

## Run the Solution

- **TypeScript:** `npx tsx src/typescript/chapter04/exercise03.ts`
- **Go:** `go run src/go/chapter04/exercise03/main.go`
