# Exercise 2: Array vs Set Operations

Demonstrate the difference in step counts between arrays and sets for search operations.

## Key Concepts

- **Array search:** O(N) - must check each element sequentially
- **Set lookup:** O(1) - direct hash-based access

## Run the Solution

- **TypeScript:** `npx tsx src/typescript/chapter01/exercise02.ts`
- **Go:** `go run src/go/chapter01/exercise02/main.go`
