# Exercise 6: Greedy Algorithms

Solve optimization problems by making locally optimal choices.

## Key Concepts

- Make the best choice at each step
- Don't reconsider past choices
- Works when local optimum leads to global optimum

## Run the Solution

- **TypeScript:** `npx tsx src/typescript/chapter20/exercise06.ts`
- **Go:** `go run src/go/chapter20/exercise06/main.go`
